Hello! My name is Nina I'm currently a senior studying 6-14 and 15-2 (Computer Science + Econ and Business Analytics). 

Professionally, most of my experience throughout various interships has been in the 
project management and feature design sphere, and my aim is to continue on that path for the immediate future. What I really enjoy about project management is the ability to work and connect with people from all different sorts of teams, as well as the sense of ownership that comes along with following a product through its entire lifecycle.

This fall, I'm taking a pretty big breath of classes. In addition to finishing up some requirements, I'm taking a class on organizational processes, a software design class, and a class where I get to write an empirical research paper! I love taking a diverse courseload, as I truly believe that interdisciplinary studies is a valuable and necessary method of understanding different perspectives.

Outside of school, I love video-editing, taking walks, and listening to podcasts. I'm also involved in MIT's Chinese Students Club as co-social media chair. One personal challenge for myself this year is to learn Korean (and get better at Chinese, my parent's native language).
